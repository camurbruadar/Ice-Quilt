## 🌍 Overview

**The Ice Quilt** is a scalable, modular reflective panel system designed to float on the surface of polar and glacial meltwater to reduce solar absorption and preserve existing ice. Built using biodegradable and recycled materials, it offers a passive, cost-effective strategy to slow climate tipping points without requiring power, chemicals, or infrastructure.

This repository contains all design blueprints, fabrication guides, material costs, legal documentation, and outreach kits needed to replicate or expand the Ice Quilt worldwide.
