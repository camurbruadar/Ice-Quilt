## 🌍 What Is the Ice Quilt?

The **Ice Quilt** is a scalable, open-source solution to reduce ice melt in polar and glacial regions. It uses low-cost, biodegradable, and recyclable materials to reflect sunlight away from meltwater and exposed ice, buying time for ecosystems under pressure.

You can help — even if you're not a scientist.

## 🚀 3 Ways You Can Help

### 1. **Share It**
Help more people find this project:
- Post the [GitHub link](https://github.com/camurbruadar/Ice-Quilt) to climate forums, Reddit, or Twitter (use hashtag **#IceQuilt**)
- Send it to local climate groups, scientists, teachers, or makerspaces
- Translate the README or fabrication guide into another language

### 2. **Build or Prototype**
You don’t need a lab — just basic tools and time:
- Use the fabrication guide to make a small version
- Test reflectivity or flotation in your local area
- Share photos, results, or improvements back to the GitHub repo

### 3. **Connect It**
Send the Ice Quilt to people or orgs who can scale it:
- Research centers (like Woodwell or Project Drawdown)
- Arctic and glacial field scientists
- NGOs working on climate mitigation
- Teachers looking for open-source climate projects
